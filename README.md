# kotlin-aidev-template

The purpose of this project is to serve as a starting point for new Kotlin projects that leverage AI-assisted development.

## Features

- Multi-module Kotlin project structure
- Comprehensive coding standards for both humans and AI assistants
- Maven configuration with shade plugin for executable JARs
- Sample infrastructure (web server, database integration)
- Testing framework setup

## Documentation

All project documentation is located in the `doc/` directory:

- [Project Overview](doc/project_overview.md)
- Code Standards:
  - [General Code Standards](doc/code_standards/code_standards.md)
  - [AI Standards](doc/code_standards/ai_standards.md)
  - [Testing Standards](doc/code_standards/testing_standards.md)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Rename packages and Maven coordinates to match your project
3. Review the coding standards documentation
4. Start building your modules following the established patterns

## AI-Assisted Development

This template is specifically designed to work well with AI coding assistants like Claude, Claude Code, and ChatGPT. When using AI tools with this codebase:

1. Refer the AI to the documentation in `doc/`
2. Ask the AI to follow the established coding standards
3. Validate generated code against the project standards
