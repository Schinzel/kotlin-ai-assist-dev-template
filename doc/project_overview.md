# AI assisted development

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to serve as a template for creating Kotlin multi-module projects optimized for AI-assisted development.

## Key Features

### Multi-Module Architecture
This template is structured as a multi-module Maven project, allowing for:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent development and testing of components
- Reduced build times through focused compilation
- Better organization for AI-assisted development

### AI-Friendly Code Structure
The code organization and standards are specifically designed to:
- Small independent modules makes it easier for AI to understand and generate code
- Make it easier for AI tools to understand context and constraints
- Provide clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Establish consistent patterns for code generation
- Set explicit standards for both human and AI-written code

### Ready-To-Use Infrastructure
The template includes:
- Maven build configuration with shade plugin for executable JARs
- Basic web server setup with Javalin
- Database connectivity examples
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation structure
