# Admin Site Module

## Purpose
The purpose of this module is to provide an administrative interface for system management, configuration, and monitoring.

## Responsibilities
- Implements admin-specific web controllers and views
- Provides user management interfaces
- Implements system configuration screens
- Offers monitoring and analytics dashboards
- Handles admin-specific authentication and authorization
- Implements administrative operations UI

## Dependencies
- Depends on the Logic module for core business operations
- Depends on the Sites/Shared module for common UI components
- May use Logic/DB module for data access (through interfaces)
- May use Logic/File-Storage module for file operations (through interfaces)

## Public API
This module primarily provides HTTP endpoints for administrative functions:
- Admin-specific REST API endpoints
- Admin web interface pages
- Admin-specific authentication endpoints

## Example Usage
The admin site is typically accessed through a web browser at a dedicated URL:
```
https://example.com/admin
```

Configuration in site-starter:
```kotlin
fun startAdminSite(port: Int) {
    val adminSite = AdminSite(
        port = port,
        userService = UserServiceImpl(userRepository),
        configService = ConfigServiceImpl(),
        analyticsService = AnalyticsServiceImpl(analyticsRepository)
    )
    adminSite.start()
}
```

## Notes for AI Assistance
- Admin interfaces should have comprehensive access controls
- UI components should follow a consistent design system
- Consider implementing audit logging for admin operations
- Ensure proper validation of administrative actions
- Keep business logic in the Logic module, not in the admin site
