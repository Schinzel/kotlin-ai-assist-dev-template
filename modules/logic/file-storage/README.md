# File-Storage Module

## Purpose
The purpose of this module is to provide a unified interface for file operations, abstracting the details of where and how files are stored.

## Responsibilities
- Manages file uploads and downloads
- Handles file metadata and organization
- Provides file search capabilities
- Implements file storage strategies (local, cloud, etc.)
- Ensures file security and access control
- Handles file transformation operations (resizing, format conversion)

## Dependencies
- May depend on the Logic module for domain entities
- No circular dependencies with other infrastructure modules

## Public API
This module exposes its functionality through service interfaces:
- FileStorageService interface for standard file operations
- FileMetadataService for handling file information
- Storage strategy interfaces for different backends

## Example Usage
```kotlin
// Example of how a client would use this module
val fileStorage = FileStorageServiceImpl(
    storageStrategy = S3StorageStrategy(bucketName = "app-files"),
    metadataRepository = fileMetadataRepository
)

// Storing a file
val fileId = fileStorage.storeFile(
    fileContent = inputStream,
    fileName = "report.pdf",
    contentType = "application/pdf",
    size = 1024 * 1024,
    ownerId = userId
)

// Retrieving a file
val fileData = fileStorage.getFile(fileId)
```

Configuration:
```kotlin
val fileStorage = FileStorageServiceImpl(
    storageStrategy = when (config.storageType) {
        StorageType.LOCAL -> LocalStorageStrategy(basePath = config.localStoragePath)
        StorageType.S3 -> S3StorageStrategy(
            bucketName = config.s3BucketName,
            region = config.s3Region,
            credentials = config.awsCredentials
        )
    },
    metadataRepository = fileMetadataRepository
)
```

## Notes for AI Assistance
- Implement the strategy pattern for different storage backends
- Handle file streams efficiently to avoid memory issues with large files
- Add proper error handling for I/O operations
- Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access
- Consider implementing file chunking for large file uploads
- Add comprehensive logging for file operations
