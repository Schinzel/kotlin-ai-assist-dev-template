# Logic Module

## Purpose
The purpose of this module is to encapsulate the core business logic and domain model of the application, isolated from infrastructure concerns.

## Responsibilities
- Defines the domain models and business entities
- Implements business rules and validation logic
- Provides service interfaces for business operations
- Processes and transforms data according to business requirements
- Contains use cases and business workflows

## Dependencies
- No dependencies on other application modules (core module)
- May depend on external libraries for utilities

## Public API
This module exposes its functionality through well-defined interfaces in the `api` package:
- Service interfaces for business operations
- Domain models for data exchange
- Factory interfaces for creating domain objects

## Example Usage
```kotlin
// Example of how a client would use this module
val userService = UserServiceImpl(userRepository)
val result = userService.registerUser(
    RegistrationRequestDTO(
        email = "user@example.com",
        password = "securePassword123"
    )
)

when (result) {
    is Success -> handleSuccessfulRegistration(result.value)
    is Failure -> handleRegistrationFailure(result.error)
}
```

## Notes for AI Assistance
- Business logic should be pure and side-effect free where possible
- Avoid dependencies on specific infrastructure implementations
- Use immutable data structures for domain models
- Follow the code standards for interface design and documentation
